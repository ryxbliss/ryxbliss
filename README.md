- hello, I’m @ryxbliss ᐠ(ᐛ)ᐟ but you can call me ryx! here is A LOT of things about me! 💖
- my cultural background: my parents come from Bangladesh 🇧🇩 and I was born in England, so I'm half British half Bengali! ☕
- my current goal is to become an Architect! I desire to become someone respected and big in life! I want to bring back old architecture, because let's be real we all miss old architecture.😔
- i’m currently interested in Fnaf, Omori, and Genshin Impact! ✧༺♥༻✧
- 🌱 i’m currently learning to draw and animate, I'm also learning the العربية language and my religion Islam! I am a proud Hijabi/Niqabi 🧕
- i love expressing myself through art 🎨, I would like to get into painting and Arabic calligraphy (or just calligraphy in general)!
- 📖 i'm currently reading: Anne of Green Gables & the Percy Jackson Series.
- (☞ ᐛ )☞ how to reach me: you can message me on Pinterest or Reddit!
- pronouns: she/her & nothing else.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a unique ear shape that I see nobody else has, where the upper part of my ear's outer rim has an additional fold/in award curvature.
also at the bottom of my ear instead of my earlobe curving upwards 👂, my earlobe has a more straight/slightly downward shape. my ear is unique to everyone else's!
- a thing not a lot of people know about me is that I'm rather aware, people around me think I don't know things! (•̀_•́)
- my favourite animals are: Giraffes 𓃱, Arctic Foxes 𓃒, and Peacocks! they're all so beautiful! but if I could have a pet, I would want cats of all breeds! and maybe a peacock if I could get one 🥰
